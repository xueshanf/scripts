## Code is based from https://github.com/isislovecruft/scripts/blob/master/check-commit-signature, and
## https://github.com/saab-simc-admin/scripts/blob/master/check-commit-signature
## Used on Gitlab to create custom_hooks per repo.
##
## Changes: 
## 1. gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.16: signature returns "RSA key" with 10 charaters, instead of "Key ID" with 8 characters
## 2. setup GNUPGHOME in project's custom_hook/.gnugp directory on Gitlab server. 
## 3. store collaboraters' fingerprints in ./custom_hooks/fingerprints and will be sourced.
# Setup gpg home: see README-setup.md for Gitlab backend initial setup.
# This code runs as git user on Gitlab server.

# collaborators's fingerprints array file 
source ${PWD}/custom_hooks/fingerprints
export GNUPGHOME=${PWD}/custom_hooks/.gnugp

#
# check-commit-signature
# ----------------------
# A server-side update git hook for checking the GPG signature of a pushed
# commit.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunsignedcommits
#   This boolean sets whether unsigned tags, and merges with unsigned commits
#   into master, are allowed. By default, they are not allowed.
# hooks.allowunsignedtags
#   This boolean sets whether unsigned tags are allowed. By default,
#   they are not allowed.
# hooks.allowcommitsonmaster
#   This boolean sets whether non-merge commits are allowed on master. By
#   default, these are not allowed.
# hooks.allowhotfixonmaster
#   The boolean sets whether branches beginning with hotfix-* are allowed on
#   master. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. CURRENTLY IGNORED.
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.
